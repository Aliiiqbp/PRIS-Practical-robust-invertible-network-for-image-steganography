# This is the official code for PRIS: Practical robust invertible network for image steganography

### PRIS is a deep learning method for image steganography, it can hide a secret image into a host image as long as those two images shared same resolution. And PRIS is also robust to many attacks, such as Gaussian and JPEG compression. Demonstration of our model in practical at http://yanghang.site/hide.
